This tool is based on a drug scoring model, <b> normalized drug response </b> (NDR). The formulation of NDR accounts for differences in cell growth rates as well as experimental noise, and considers both positive and negative control conditions to characterize drug-induced effects.NDR has an improved performance of when compared to the existing metrics in assessing drug responses of cancer cells across various culture models. More details about this metric can be found in:

To use this tool, one must ensure that the input files are properly formatted. As the column names are crucial for processing, these need to be verified before computing NDR. The example files can be downloaded using these links:
